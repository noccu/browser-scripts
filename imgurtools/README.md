A script that adds some extra orgnizational ability to Imgur albums.

### Features ###

* Copy and move images between albums.
* Clear entire albums.
* See change in album views since last visit.
* Cross-brower (hopefully)
    * Should work in Fire/Waterfox and Chrome anyway.

### Download ###

* Install ImgurAlbumOps.user.js with your favourite script manager.

### Usage ###

* Use the added buttons on the right side of albums.

### Can I help? ###

* File bugs and feature requests in the tracker.
* Submit patches, why not. Code's a mess though.
