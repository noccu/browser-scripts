A script to aid downloading Pixiv images and animations.
For now it's only a (growing) few scripts, awaiting me slowly fixing up my older scripts to merge in and eventually combine into one.

### Features ###

* Fullsize image dl links including manga pages in manga view.
* Download UgoIra animations as dithered GIFs.
* Create backlinks in large/single mode manga image views.
* Cross-brower (hopefully)
    * Should work in Fire/Waterfox and Chrome anyway.

### Download ###

* Install pixivtools.user.js with your favourite script manager.

### Usage ###

* Use the added buttons under the image.

### Can I help? ###

* File bugs and feature requests in the tracker.
* Submit patches, why not. Code's a mess though.
